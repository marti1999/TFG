# TFG

This repository contains all the information, files and data that has been used in the project.
It consists of three main directories:
- Documents: all the files that were given to us as a guide for the project
- informes: reports that were delivered, paper, presentation, auxiliary documents, LaTeX code and images, etc...
- src: the actual project. Besides all the code, it also has the data used as input, all the output images, and a csv file with all the experiment results.
