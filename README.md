# TFG

## Content
This repository contains all the information, files and data that has been used in the project.
It consists of three main directories:
- Documents: all the files that were given to us as a guide for the project
- informes: reports that were delivered, paper, presentation, auxiliary documents, LaTeX code and images, etc...
- src: the actual project. Besides all the code, it also has the data used as input, all the output images, and a csv file with all the experiment results.

## Changelog
### Initial report
After delivering the initial report, the following changes were made:
1. Overall enhancement of the report, expanding its content
2. Creating a planification dividing the project in parts and subparts, assigning each of them to a different week.
3. A kant diagram representing the planification.
4. Research on the state of art
5. Besides stating the objectives, actually defining them and making it clearer when such objectives would be achieved.

### 1st progress report
1. Adding examples and formulas when explaining the features extraction methods for shallow learning.
2. Instead of showing 6 graphs with 2 balues each, merging them all together so it is easier to compare all the twelve values.
3. Explanation on how are the experiments and results stored and later fetched for reference.
4. Properly ploting confidence in predictions. Instead of using a single histgram for each prediction type (TP, TN, FP, FN), merging them all into a single plot and showing distribution functions.

### 2nd progress report
1. Doing a better explanation on what neural networks are and which  kind I am using.
2. Properly explaining word embedding and GloVe.
3. Adding old results into the new plots showing the metrics using all the different types of RNN.
4. Expanding the conclusions so they don't feel that empty. Removing some explanations from the results that fit into the conclusions.

### Paper proposal
1. Adding captions to figures with some explanation on what they are or mean.
2. Adding Kant Diagram to the apendix.
3. Describing datasets.
4. Removing stuff from the instroduction that I was not able to do due to the lack of time and planitication.
5. Reducing 3.3
6. Improving the title for 3.4 and 3.5
7. Moving explanation of the methodology from Results to Methodology & Planitication.
8. Adding all the deep learning plots to their section, instead than using them on the appendix.
9. Fixing typos.
10. No longer using "lists" when there is no need to.
11. Improving references, no longer taking up that much space because of the long links.
